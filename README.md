# Eureka Network

PoS/Pow Hybrid EVM compatible substrate blockchain. Project started for EthDenver 2021. 

## Pallets Used
 
 - EVM
 - Staking
 - Grandpa
 - Aura 
 - Atomic Swap
 - Vesting
 - Assets
 - Balances
 - Multisig
 - Transaction payment
 - Timestamp
 - Randomness
 - Sudo

### Future Plans

- Launch Live Testnet
- Create ETH/DOT Plasma bridge
- Cross Chain Atomic Swaps 
- Port Existing ETH tools for evm chains on the dot ecosystem
- Build Wallet, Block Explorer & Vaildator UI for Eureka

### Rust Setup

Setup instructions for working with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language can
be found at the
[Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started). Follow those
steps to install [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) and configure the Rust toolchain to default to the
latest stable version.

### Makefile

This project uses a [Makefile](Makefile) to document helpful commands and make it easier to execute
them. Get started by running these [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
targets:

1. `make init` - Run the [init script](scripts/init.sh) to configure the Rust toolchain for
   [WebAssembly compilation](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/#webassembly-compilation).
1. `make run` - Build and launch this project in development mode.

The init script and Makefile both specify the version of the
[Rust nightly compiler](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/#rust-nightly-toolchain)
that this project depends on.

### Build

The `make run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

### Run in Docker

First, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then run the following command to start a single node development chain.

```bash
./scripts/docker_run.sh
```

This command will firstly compile your code, and then start a local development network. You can
also replace the default command (`cargo build --release && ./target/release/node-template --dev --ws-external`)
by appending your own. A few useful ones are as follow.

```bash
# Run Substrate node without re-compiling
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/node-template --dev --ws-external

# Purge the local dev chain
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev

# Check whether the code is compilable
./scripts/docker_run.sh cargo check
```
